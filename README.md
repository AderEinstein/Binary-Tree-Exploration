# Binary Tree Exploration

Usage:
- Open the visual studio solution file in the root folder with your latest version of visual studio.
- Compile and run from your IDE.

This program exlores the following operations on a binary tree data structure:

a)	Inserting nodes to the binary tree
b)	Swaping two nodes on the binary tree
c)	An algorithm to Sort the binary tree 
d)	Removing a node from the binary tree without breaking the remaining tree structure

Furthermore, it implements the following search algorithms on the binary tree and inserts a large number of nodes into the tree, measures the performance of each of the search algorithms (time to complete), and analyses the Big-O time complexity of each (Best case, average case, worst case):

e)	a brute force search algorithm
f)	a depth-first search algorithm
g)	a breadth first search algorithm
